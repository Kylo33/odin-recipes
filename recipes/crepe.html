    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 cup soy milk</li>
      <li>1/2 cup water</li>
      <li>1/4 cup melted soy margarine</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons maple syrup</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon turbinado sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix flour, soy milk, water, 1/4 cup soy margarine, maple syrup, sugar, and
        salt together in a large mixing bowl until combined; cover and chill for 2 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lightly grease a 6-inch skillet with some soy margarine. Heat the skillet over
        medium heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour 2 to 3 tablespoons of batter into the skillet and immediately rotate the skillet
        to spread batter out in a thin layer. Cook until the top of the crêpe is no longer wet
        and the bottom has turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Run a spatula around the edge
        of the skillet to loosen crêpe; flip and cook until the other side has turned light
        brown, about 1 minute more. Repeat with remaining batter.
