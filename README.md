# Odin Recipes

Basic recipe website built to complete the [first project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) for [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com/).

This website will feature a main page that links out to recipes on other pages.

## Learning Objectives

- Improve familiarity with HTML and HTML elements
- Practice links between pages
- Gain experience with Git and write better commit messages.

## Reflection

Through this project, I have regained my confidence in my HTML abilities and vastly improved my workflow with git. I used the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0) that was a supplemental resource in The Odin Project's [commit messages lesson](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-commit-messages). I think that this workflow works well for me, and it is really helpful to know the character limits and standards.
